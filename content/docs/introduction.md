## Nevo Framework

Nevo is `modern tool` for building responsive user interfaces. It's a SASS-powered framework driven by many built-in modules and custom solutions that gives you extra functionality.

The framework provides a seamless design process with all the latest `CSS features` and `SASS benefits` such as variables, maps, mixins, functions and more.

Powerful `settings` allows you to manage a flexible structure and change the theme preferences exactly to your needs.

Start creating with your preferred system. Style your website in a `classic way` or build responsive designs directly in HTML usign a modern `utility-first` method.

## Sass Language

Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. Since Nevo is based on Sass, it’s good to highlight some changes for new users.

The core team [recently](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched) implemented a bunch of brand new features. One of the biggest changes is the `module system`. It can be confusing at first as it brings a slightly different working principle compared to the previous one with the `@import` method.

But don’t worry, it’s easy to switch and module system is actually the recommended method for all new projects. The old sass features will be officially deprecated in the near future.

The new `@use` and `@forward` rules are similar to `@import` so don't let that confuse you.

For more information on the new system, visit the official sass [documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).
